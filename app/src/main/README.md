Answer to hypothetical question:
For multiplication operation, we need to add a new view in layout\activity_main
(and in land\activity_main) a new "TextView" and to do a redesign of the button's location on the
screen. Also, we need to add new functions in SimpleCalculator/Impl in order to support a new
mathematical operation. In addition in MainActivity class, we need to add a new listener to the
multiplication button. We can use the same test as previously and in addition to adding new tests
that will exam our an application under a new operation -- exam activity and an app itself.
